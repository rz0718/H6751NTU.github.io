# BT5153 Applied Machine Learning for Business Analytics

#### <center>NUS, MSBA / Spring 2020</center>

## <font color='DarkOrange'>Content</font>

This module provides students a deep overview of various advanced machine learning techniques applied to business analytics tasks. The focus of this course will be the key and intuitive idea behind machine learning models and hands-on examples instead of theoretical analysis. The tentative topics include machine learning pipeline, unsupervised learning, structure learning, Bayesian learning, deep learning and generative models. The programming languages used will be Python.

### Assignments (20%)

There are two assignments. One is a weekly assignment and the other is a mini two-weeks Kaggle competition. Students are expected to complete these two individual assignment to gauge their understanding of the course materials so as to prepare them for their Group Project and future data science tasks. Through lectures and programming assignments students will learn the necessary engineering tricks for making neural networks work on practical problems. Details of the individual assignment and Kaggle competition will be updated later. 

- **Credit**:
  * Assignment 1 (10%): 
  * Kaggle Competition (10%)
 

### Midterm Exam (30%)

Students are expected to attend the Midterm Examination. It will be open-book and open-notes. It will focus on the application of the materials covered in class. The mode of the delivery of the examination will be determined and announced later.

### Group Project (50%)

You are required to form a project group with 4-5 members. Students can form their own teams and please fill out the google sheets. If a student can’t find a partner, we will team you up randomly (send the email to our TAs). Your project task is to apply the data mining and machine learning techniques that you have acquired to gain insights and draw interesting conclusions to a (business) problem. You are to apply (advanced) data mining and analytics tools (preferably in Python as Python tools are used as supplementary aids during the delivery of this course) to process structured and unstructured data available on the Web. You will then summarize your insights and present your conclusions using suitable visual aids. More detailed information can be found [here](project/project.md).

- **Credit**:
  * Project proposal (10%) 
  * Project presentation (25%)
  * Project final report (15%)
